				As a computer and systems engineer, I have acquired a solid theoretical and practical
				background in various areas of computer science and software development. Throughout my
				career, I have developed key competencies in programming, systems administration,
				networking, databases, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity. My studies have allowed
				me to work in interdisciplinary projects and apply agile methodologies for the development
				of innovative technological solutions.

				<br />
				<br />

				During my studies, I have had the opportunity to participate in significant projects that
				have allowed me to apply and expand my knowledge in various fields of systems engineering.
				Below, I present some outstanding examples:

				<ul class='ml-4 list-disc text-muted-foreground'>
					<li>
						Implemented a web application using Repositories and Clean Architecture patterns. I developed the business logic with C# and React, ensuring a clear separation of responsibilities and maintainable code. The application interacts with a SQL database, ensuring efficient and secure data management.
					</li>
					<li>
						In the machine learning subject, I developed a geolocation model using the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm to determine the location based on temperature data. The model was implemented in Python and leveraged historical temperature datasets to predict the geographical position with high accuracy.
					</li>
					<li>
						For network administration, I performed the creation, configuration and administration
						of a server farm using simulation tools such as Cisco Packet Tracer, and moving them to a local server with many computers. This project
						included the implementation of security policies and network traffic monitoring.
					</li>

					<li>
						Implementation of a two-factor authentication system for a web application mentioned
						above, using cryptography and hashing techniques. This project strengthened my
						understanding of best practices in cybersecurity and data protection.
